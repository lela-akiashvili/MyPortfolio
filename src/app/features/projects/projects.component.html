          <span> Site Description:</span>
          A dynamic racing simulation web application built with Angular (CLI
          v18.1.3). This project was developed as part of a task in a larger
          project, with the backend API provided by the organizers. It includes
          CRUD operations for car management, interactive race animations, and
          paginated views for garages and winners.<br />
          <b>Note</b>: To experience full functionality, run the backend locally
          using

          with HTML and SASS, inspired by a Wix template. <br />
          It is fully responsive across all common devices, with a strong
          emphasis on animations and breakpoints. I imported various fonts from
          Google Fonts to enhance the design's appeal and carefully utilized
          positioning for optimal layout.

          This site is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a strong
          emphasis on functionality. <br />
          The main purpose is to allow visitors to search for movies of interest
          based on the names of books they input. Additionally, the site offers
          users the ability to find books by filtering and bookmarking them,
          even without signing in. Authorization and authentication are
          simulated using local storage as a database, enabling different users
          to maintain their personal libraries.
          <br />
          For this project, I utilized two separate APIs: the Open Library API
          and the OMDb API. However, since the OMDb API is not secure, obtaining
          movie results is only possible when the site is run on a local host.

          <span>Site Description:</span> <br />
          This site is dedicated to sports news, featuring mock data with
          fictional characters. It enables users to scroll through the latest
          sports news and filter it based on search input, sport, or creation
          date. <br />
          Signed-in users can favorite news articles to read later. Registered
          users can also write, publish, and delete their own news articles,
          with email verification ensuring the authenticity of registrations.
          <br />
          The site mimics and extends the user hierarchy found in the Teams
          application, offering four types of users: Regular User, Team's Coach,
          Manager, and Player. Each user type has different capabilities:
          <li>
            <b>Coach</b>: Can add or delete players and managers (this
            functionality needs to be correctly implemented).
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Manager</b>: Can plan games and write announcements for the team.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Player</b>: Can read announcements and view games on their
            profile page.
          </li>
          This project extensively uses RxJS for stream control and database
          connections, as well as reactive forms for various functionalities.

          The site uses the Fetch API to fetch current weather data from

          time. Users can also check the weather and average temperature for the
          next seven days, as well as the current temperature and time of any
          city they search for in the search bar. The site uses local storage to
          save and display data for searched cities. <br />
